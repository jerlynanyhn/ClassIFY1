----------------------

How to run:
1. (Optional) Install calendar widget: pip install tkcalendar
2. Run the app: python3 ClassIFY.py

Files created:
- ClassIFY.db          : SQLite database file (persistent storage)
- ClassIFY_tables.sql  : CREATE TABLE statements for the schema
- ClassIFY_data.sql    : Sample INSERT statements (seed data)
- USER_Manual.txt      : This manual

Quick overview:
- Home/Dashboard: See today's classes, monthly calendar, today's to-dos, and subjects with goals.
- Subjects: Add/Edit/Delete subjects. Fields: SubjectCode, Name, Instructor, Units, Goals (max 100 chars)
- Tasks: Add tasks linked to SubjectCode. Fields: TaskName, SubjectCode, Deadline(YYYY-MM-DD), Priority, Status.
- Schedule: Weekly grid (Mon..Sun) for class schedule entries (SubjectCode, StartTime, EndTime, Room). Click cells to add, click entries to select for edit/delete.
- Records/Reports: Run pre-built reports (All Subjects with Tasks, Upcoming Tasks, Tasks Today, Completed Tasks, Missing Tasks, Schedule for Today). Export to CSV allowed.

Important notes:
- All tables persist between runs. Data is not dropped on startup.
- Sample data is inserted only when the subjects table is empty (first run).
- Goals field supports up to 100 characters. A character counter is shown in the UI.
- Deleting a subject cascades and removes related tasks and schedule entries.
- SubjectCode is used as the primary key for subjects and as a foreign key in tasks and schedule.
- Tasks use auto-increment TaskID for uniqueness (hidden from user).

1. All Subjects with Tasks: Shows all subjects with their associated tasks
2. Upcoming Tasks: Tasks due from tomorrow forward
3. Tasks Today: Tasks due today
4. Completed Tasks: All completed tasks
